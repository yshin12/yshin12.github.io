Note on EDI
- Can divide the problem into different layers
	- Studnet education
	- Academic society 

[Student level]
- Nurtured by clear-mind intellectuals
- Ariel Rubinstein. Jungle economics talk. Econ peoples are less sympathetic on profit max/layoff decision experiments. The equivlance between the GE and the jungle economy model (the strong takes all)
- Krusell & Smith paper. Heterogeneity model. Welth distribution. patience level. Heads up. Abuse it for justifying the right-wing ideology
- Statistical discrimination literature. Female/racial minority etc. Huge proportion of the unexplained parts. Abuse this for arguing the right-wing ideology

[Peer level]
- Spend my effort continuously
- Wemen in Econometrics conference (Oct 2022). Share the idea. Panel discussions
- Put yourself into others' shoe --> very important. 
- 4 different countries, several different institutions.
